# Wolf's Den, Python + BearLibTerminal Edition

This is a Python + BearLibTerminal port of my roguelike concept Wolf's Den that I use for learning/practicing programming languages.
This will be worked on as time and interest allow. There are a lot of these in various languages.

# How to Run

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Rakaneth/wolfs-den-bearlib-python`
2. Construct a Python 3.7 virtual environment on your system in an appropriate location.
2. Activate your new environment.
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the activated environment to install the packages.
5. Run `python main.py`.

# DONE
